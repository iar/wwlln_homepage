WWLLN Website

The bulk of the content is powered through Wordpress using the custom WWLLN theme that replicates the HTML5 template
made by Halcyonic (see below).  Several pages (hosts, publications, spectra) generate part of their content
dynamically through the flat .htm text files in the root directory.  The pages for the lightning maps are submodules
of the lightning repository to keep those projects separate.

A somewhat unusual but interesting responsive site template. I did this one to test out a 
new pattern set I put together and I think it really came together well. As for use cases 
it's kind of unspecific so hey, use it for whatever.

Feedback, bug reports, and comments are not only welcome, but strongly encouraged :)
